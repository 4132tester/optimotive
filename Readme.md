# Repository for automation test task demonstration

This project contains an automation test for the Optimove Careers page using Selenium WebDriver and Python.

## Prerequisites

To run the tests locally, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- pip package manager
- Mozilla Firefox browser

Install the required Python dependencies (`pip install pytest selenium`)
  
After installing Python, ensure that it is added to the PATH environment variable.

Add the project root directory to the PATH environment variable to ensure geckodriver can be accessed from anywhere (alternatively - download the appropriate version of geckodriver from the Mozilla GeckoDriver releases page and add it's location to the PATH environment variable)

## Running the Tests
To run the automation tests, execute the following command from the project directory:

`python -m pytest`

This command will discover and run the test case in the project. The test results will be displayed in the terminal.
